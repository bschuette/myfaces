            The sandbox is a MyFaces subproject that is a testing ground for potential new additions to the Tomahawk project.  It 
            primarily consists of components, but like the Tomahawk project, it can also contain validators and other useful JSF 
            "goodies."
        </p>
        <warning label="Warning">
            These components are a work in progress.  In many cases they are checked in without being 100% feature complete.  Testing 
            is generally minimal and there is no guarantee that something you use in sandbox will ever be promoted to an official 
            release in Tomahawk.
