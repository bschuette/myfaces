  <description>
    JSF components and utilities that can be used with any JSF implementation.
    This library is compatible with both JSF1.1 and JSF1.2; however for JSF1.2 users there
    is an alternative build of Tomahawk available that takes advantage of JSF1.2 features to
    offer some additional benefits.
